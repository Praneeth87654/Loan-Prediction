# Loan Prediction

## Overview  
The **Loan Prediction System** is a machine learning-based project designed to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant details. The project utilizes advanced data preprocessing techniques, multiple classification algorithms, and a Flask-based web interface for user interaction.  

## Key Features  
- **Balanced Dataset**: Used SMOTETomek to handle class imbalance.
- **Multiple Models**: Implemented Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost for predictions.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized model performance using Grid Search and Random Search.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed a Flask web application for collecting user inputs and displaying predictions.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved reliable predictions through thorough evaluation and fine-tuning.
